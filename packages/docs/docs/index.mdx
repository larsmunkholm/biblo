# Introduction

## ðŸ¤” What is this?

Biblo helps you create your very own "library" of components. It is basically a list of all the components you have developed for your app, each with a list of examples of the component with different properties.

Biblo was inspired by **StoryBook**, and the easily manageable workflow it provides in creating a component library. So if that is something you know and love, you might also like this.

However, since Biblo is meant to exist inside your app (and not as a separate thing like StoryBook), you have the possibility to ðŸ’… style every part of it or even exchange most of the parts with your own components, truly making it a part of your app.

## ðŸ¤· How does it work?

Using `require.context`, it is possible import to all the exports from a bunch of files using a regular expression.

Just like with StoryBook, these files (usually ending in `.biblo.tsx`) must be set up with a **default export** containing the basic information about the component and a number of **named exports** all representing different versions of the component (different properties).

## ðŸ‘· What do you need?

You'll need support for `require.context`, which was introduced in **Metro version 0.72.1**.

So...

- Make sure React Native is version **0.70.0** or newer.
- Or if you're using Expo, you'll need version **47.0.0** or newer.
