## 📚 Documentation

Documentation can be found at [biblo.saxofonsolo.dk](https://biblo.saxofonsolo.dk/).

## 📘 Introduction

Biblo helps you create your very own "library" of components. It is basically a list of all the components you have developed for your app, each with a list of examples of the component with different properties.

Biblo was inspired by **StoryBook**, and the easily manageable workflow it provides in creating a component library. So if that is something you know and love, you might also like this.

However, since Biblo is meant to exist inside your app (and not as a separate thing like StoryBook), you have the possibility to 💅 style every part of it or even exchange most of the parts with your own components, truly making it a part of your app.
